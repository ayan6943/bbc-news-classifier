# 📰 BBC News Text Classifier using Logistic Regression (TF-IDF + NLP)

A deep learning-powered multi-class **news topic classifier** trained on the BBC News dataset using **Azure ML**, **TF-IDF**, and classical NLP techniques. Deployed and tested inside Azure ML Studio with reproducible pipeline-based workflow.

> 🚀 Achieved **96.6% accuracy** across 5 news categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech.

## ☁️ Powered by Azure Machine Learning

- Built, trained, and evaluated entirely within **Azure ML Studio**
- Used **Compute Instance** for model training and TF-IDF preprocessing
- Leveraged **Notebook Interface**, custom Python environments, and data versioning
- Explored deployment endpoint creation (but deferred to local inference to avoid cloud compute costs)

This demonstrates strong familiarity with **Azure’s cloud ML ecosystem** — critical for real-world scalable ML applications.
